## Loading the data

```{r load-data, cache=TRUE}
myStocks <- c("AAPL","JPM","DIS","DPZ","ANF","SPY" ) %>%
  
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2017-08-01",
         to   = "2020-09-30") %>%
  
  group_by(symbol) 

str(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

For each ticker symbol, the data frame contains its `symbol`, the `date`, the prices for `open`,`high`, `low` and `close`, and the `volume`, or how many stocks were traded on that day. More importantly, the data frame contains the `adjusted` closing price, which adjusts for any stock splits and/or dividends paid and this is what we will be using for our analyses.

Towards the end, you a see a line `- attr(*, "group_sizes")= int  1761 1761 1761 1761 1761 1761 1761 1761`.
Since we grouped our data by its ticker symbol, you can see that over the course of 7 years (2011-2017) we have 1761 trading days, or roughly 250 trading days per year. 

Financial performance and CAPM analysis depend on __returns__ and not on __adjusted closing prices__. So given the adjusted closing prices, our firststep is to calculate daily and monthly returns. 

```{r calculate_returns,include=FALSE}

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly.returns") 

#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily.returns")  
```


For yearly and monthly data, we assume discrete changes, so we the formula used to calculate the return for month __(t+1)__ is 

$Return(t+1)= \frac{Adj.Close(t+1)}{Adj.Close (t)}-1$

For daily data we use log returns,  or $Return(t+1)= LN\frac{Adj.Close(t+1)}{Adj.Close (t)}$

The reason we use log returns are:

a.	Compound interest interpretation; namely, that the log return can be interpreted as the continuously (rather than discretely) compounded rate of return

b.	Log returns are assumed to follow a normal distribution

c.	Log return over n periods is the sum of n log returns


We may want to see what our investments would have grown to, of we had invested $1000 in each of the assets  on Aug 1, 2017. 

```{r wealth_index, echo=FALSE}
#calculate 'daily'wealth' returns, or what a 100 investment will grow to 
cumulative_wealth <- myStocks_returns_daily %>%
  
  mutate(wealth.index = 1000 * cumprod(1 + daily.returns))


ggplot(cumulative_wealth, aes(x=date, y = wealth.index))+
  
  geom_line(aes(colour=symbol))+
  
  labs(x="Year", 
       y="Value of investment", 
       title = "Growth of a $1000 investment over time") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  
  theme_minimal()+
  
  NULL
```

## Scatterplots of individual stocks returns versus S&P500 Index returns.

Besides these exploratory graphs of returns and price evolution, we also need to create scatterplots among the returns of different stocks. `ggpairs` crates a scattterplot matrix that shows the distribution of returns for each stock, and a matrix of scatter plots and correlations. This may take a while to run, but look at the last row, the last column and along the diagonal.


```{r correlationMatrix, echo=FALSE}
#calculate daily returns
monthly_capm_returns <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>%
  
            spread(key = symbol, value = monthly.returns)  #just keep the period returns grouped by symbol


ggpairs(monthly_capm_returns[-1]) #exclude "Date", the first column, from the correlation matrix

```

The next step is to fit a liner regression model to calculate the $\beta$ of AAPL. After fitting the model, we produce a summary table for the regression model, a 95% confidence interval for the coefficients, and an ANOVA table that shows the split of variability (`Sum Sq`) of AAPL returns and what portion ix explained by the market (`SPY`) versus the unexplained residuals.

Besides fitting the model, we should also have a look at the residuals. Do they seem to follow a Normal Distribution? Is there a pattern in the residuals, or do they appear to be 'random'? Is the variance of the residuals constant or does it seem to increase with increasing values of X?


First, we plot the residuals vs. the fitted (or predicted) values. This is a standard regression diagnostic plot to check whether there is no pattern in the residuals, as well as to test for heteroscedasticity, or whether the residuals appear to have unequal, non-constant variance.

The second thing we must check is whether the residuals follow a Normal distribution. A normal scores, or a QQ plot,  allows us to check for skewness, kurtosis and outliers.

```{r AAPL_CAPM, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(monthly_capm_returns, aes(x=SPY, y = AAPL))+
  
  geom_point()+
  
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)

aapl_capm <- lm(AAPL ~ SPY, data = monthly_capm_returns)

mosaic::msummary(aapl_capm)

aapl_capm %>% broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE)

aapl_capm %>% broom::glance()

autoplot(aapl_capm)
```

>From the result of regession, we could see the beta of APPL is 1.27993 and the adjusted R-squared is 0.4239. 
For the residuals vs fitted plot, residuals are random, with no pattern, and around Y = 0. For the Normal Q-Q plot, deviations from a straight line indicate that residuals follows a Normal distribution.
